I am an enthusiastic developer who trained at 8th Light, a software consultancy.
I'm a self-starter with extensive experience working in customer-facing and user-focused roles in a range of environments: from IT to project management and office management. I'm a quick learner with a keen interest in exploring web technologies, and a genuine passion for solving everyday problems through code. I was part of the core team at Blackgirl.tech and used my skills to help get more black women and girls into the tech industry.
I am looking for a working environment where I can continue to learn and grow as a developer.

I have significant experience in planning, organising and executing sevaral different level projects. I have project managed several office moves nationally and upgraded IT infrastructure.
