I am an enthusiastic developer who trained at 8th Light, a software consultancy.
I'm a self-starter with extensive experience working in customer-facing and user-focused roles in a range of environments: from IT to project management and office management. I'm a quick learner with a keen interest in exploring web technologies, and a genuine passion for solving everyday problems through code. I was part of the core team at Blackgirl.tech and used my skills to help get more black women and girls into the tech industry.
I am looking for a working environment where I can continue to learn and grow as a developer.

#### Training & Communication

I pride myself in my training and communication abilities. I have demonstrated experience in varied scenarios from one to one to organisational wide training.

- I provided training, mentorship and support to participants on a number of social media platforms, Microsoft Office programs and Office Administration, as part of the Employment Preparation Programme.
- Designed and executed branch-wide training sessions; delivered staff and sales briefings for all new products, software and procedures. Ensured quality control and coordination of all technical processes and continually developed the service standards within several branches, which increased the overall efficiency of all systems and processes
- I am able to communicate effectively with people on all levels; explaining technical topics to people without an engineering background.

#### Project Management

I have significant experience in planning, organising and executing several different level projects. I have project managed several office moves nationally and upgraded IT infrastructure.

- In a previous role, I managed the relocation of two regional offices (Manchester and Newcastle), including the set up of IT services and space planning. Managed several stakeholders during the projects from regional teams to third party suppliers.
- Successfully created a brand new region for The Frontline in Milton Keynes. This included contract negotiation for leasing of office and space planning to take into account team growth. Set up of IT services in a timely fashion so the new team can get up and running as soon as possible.
